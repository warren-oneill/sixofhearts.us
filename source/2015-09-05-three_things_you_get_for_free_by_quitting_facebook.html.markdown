Given the different places I've been fortunate enough to have been in my twenties and the contacts I've accumulated along the way, deactivating my Facebook account was a hard decision. It's been the one sure bet on where I can find someone I'd met or get in touch with someone I wanted to contact. But the nagging question of "Why the hell am I looking at this right now?" that lingered in the back of my mind eventually triumphed, and I haven't looked back.

Now I do want to say that, when I deactivated my Facebook, I promised to myself that I wouldn't be "that guy" that tells everyone about the radical decision he'd made. But the quality of my life has improved so dramatically in such a short amount of time that it seemed silly not to share the potential benefits with others. Specifically, I think anyone that quits Facebook can expect to gain three things immediately, based on my own experiences as well as scientific research.

## 1. You Get An Extra Hour Per Day

The first immediate benefit I noticed was that I all of a sudden had way more time. This is a huge deal for any technology entrepreneur who spends most of the day balancing head-down work, head-up work and learning.

## 2. You Get a Greater Sense of Happiness and Satisfaction

As cheesy as this one sounds, there is a lot of psychological research on brain processes to back it up.

## 3. You Get Way Better Sleep
